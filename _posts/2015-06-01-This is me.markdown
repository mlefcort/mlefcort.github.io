One significant thing that I learned is the importance of making comments within your code. As a beginner programmer, I often have to revert back in my code, and change things did not eventually work. When you fix one portion of your code and go back to work on another section, it easy to forget what exactly you were doing. When you do this, it is important that you make comments so you remember what exactly you were working on.

Another significant thing that I learned in my first week was the importance of naming your variables. After listening to Armen's lecture of variable names, I quickly realized that I was making it harder on myself by initializing variables with unrelatable names. If you give your variables confusing names, the code will be difficult for yourself and others to read
